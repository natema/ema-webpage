# My research

## Before 

Originally motivated by an interest in the theory of complex systems, my research has focused on computational dynamics [[CompDyn], [SurvDyn]], i.e., simple distributed
probabilistic algorithms which allow multi-agent systems to solve global
coordination tasks. 
This class of algorithms has been studied extensively from the perspective of
computability theory. However, due to the lack of mathematical tools to
rigorously model the behavior of these systems in the short term, efforts to
explore these dynamics algorithmically succeeded only recently. My main
contributions in this area have been on the fundamental distributed-computing
problems of Consensus [[StabCons], [NoisyUnd]], Majority Consensus [[SimpleDyn], [UndDyn], [PhaseTrans]] and Distributed Clustering [[DistCom], [MetaStab], [PPComDet], [FYPComDet]], where I have contributed
to proving rigorous results on unexpected aspects of the evolution of computational dynamics (see also [[IgnComp], [ConsBroad]]). 
Another important part of my research has been to strive to use the aforementioned mathematical tools to problems in theoretical biology, in particular the 
study of the collective behaviors of biological systems [[InfoFlow]]. 
In this respect, I have worked on the algorithmic analysis of the behavior of organisms such as ant species [[Levy]] and Physarum polycephalum [[DistFlow]].

Beside all that, I investigated some other distributed-computing problems [[RepBins], [MinMsg], [NoisCons], [ParLoad]], 
enjoyed working on some algorithm engineering project [[Kadabra]], 
and studied the complexity of certain combinatorial puzzles and games [[Candy], [PegS], [CoG]].

## Now

I'm generally interested in theoretical neuroscience, especially since I was a fellow of the [Brain and Computation Program of the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/brain2018).  
I'm working on algorithmic problems such as
network alignment [[BrainAlign]], in order to investigate, through a comparative approach, how computation is organized in the brain.
I'm also working on pruning algorithms for artificial neural networks, with some hope to get insights on synaptic pruning and related phenomena in the brain.
