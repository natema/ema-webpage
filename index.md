I am a [CNRS] researcher at ([Université
Côte d’Azur][UCA], CNRS) based in Sophia Antipolis, and a member of the [COATI
Project-Team][COATI] between [INRIA] and [I3S][I3S] .

### About

Before accepting a CNRS position in 2018, I've been a fellow of the [*Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing*](https://simons.berkeley.edu/) in the Brain and Computation Program and a postdoctoral fellow at the [*Max Planck Institute for Informatics*](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/algorithms-complexity).
In 2019, I've received the *Best Italian Young Researcher in Theoretical Computer Science* award by the Italian Chapter of the European Association of Theoretical Computer Science, from which I also received the *Best PhD Thesis in Theoretical Computer Science* in 2017. In 2016, I've been a recipient of the *Best Student Paper Award* at the European Symposium on Algorithms.

### Research

I'm currently working on questions which fall at the interface between computational neuroscience and artificial neural networks,  
and on developing an [integrated assessment modeling library](https://github.com/natema/WorldDynamics.jl) with the goal of contributing to a more environmentally sustainable society through the means of scientific computing.
[Here](/research/) I  give a quick overview of my research.
