*All things are possible,*  
*perhaps nothing is certain,*  
*but some things are more likely than others.*  


I am a [CNRS] researcher at ([Université
Côte d’Azur][UCA], CNRS) based in Sophia Antipolis, and a member of the [COATI
Project-Team][COATI] between [INRIA] and [I3S][I3S] .

## About

Before accepting a CNRS position in 2018, I've been a fellow of the [*Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing*](https://simons.berkeley.edu/) in the Brain and Computation Program and a postdoctoral fellow at the [*Max Planck Institute for Informatics*](https://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/algorithms-complexity).
In 2019, I've received the *Best Italian Young Researcher in Theoretical Computer Science* award by the Italian Chapter of the European Association of Theoretical Computer Science, from which I also received the *Best PhD Thesis in Theoretical Computer Science* in 2017. In 2016, I've been a recipient of the *Best Student Paper Award* at the European Symposium on Algorithms.

### Research

I'm currently working on questions which fall at the interface between computational neuroscience and artificial neural networks. 
More recently, I've been learning the [Julia programming language](https://julialang.org/) and I've become interested in the sub-area of scientific computing known as *Scientific Machine Learning*, with the goal of contributing to a more environmentally sustainable society through the means of computational modeling and simulation.
[Here](content/misc.md) I  give a quick overview of my research.
